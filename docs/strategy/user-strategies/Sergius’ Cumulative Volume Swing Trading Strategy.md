In our User Strategies series, we share some unique and interesting trading strategies that were previously shared in [the BigShort Discord](https://discord.com/invite/6w22gAVzMB) by our users. BigShort traders often find novel ways to use, combine, and explain using BigShort indicators to consistently win.  
  
Sergius is a BigShort user well known in the community for being consistent and profitable.   
  
In sharing this strategy Sergius starts off by saying, "DPs work great, you see millions of dollars flowing in right at the open on stocks where that usually doesn’t happen, which almost guarantees it’ll work when the price breaks that level."

**Sergius’ Swing Trading Strategy**

Sergius has honed a new swing trading method that pairs precise entry timing with volume-based indicators. Here’s how you can try it.  


## **Pre-Trade Scan**

Sergius starts by scanning for stocks with abnormal [dark pool](/indicators-and-features/Understanding Dark Pools and DarkFlow in BigShort/) (DP) activity and Short Exempt (SE) data on BigShort. He looks for sudden, large money flows early in the session. This influx often signals an imminent breakout.  


## **Trade Execution Setup**

Once a candidate is spotted, Sergius uses a unique twist: he waits for an Opening Range Breakout (ORB) triggered by the cumulative change in [Smartflow and Momoflow](/indicators-and-features/Understanding SmartFlow and MomoFlow Indicators/) (looking at the cumulative volume of each), not just price. The cumulative volume acts as a leading indicator, letting him enter _before_ price moves.   


## **Entry Criteria**

Sergius shares two clear entry setups in this type of trade:

  * **Gap Plays:** Enter when the price breaks above the pre-market value area identified in the Volume Profile.

  * **Breakouts/Pullbacks:** Look for:

    * A key point on the Volume Profile

    * A bullish market context

    * Confirmation through SE data or a divergence in SmartFlow and MomoFlow


This multi-layer confirmation ensures strong momentum.

##   
**Timeframes & Execution Precision**

The ORB can form quickly—sometimes in 3–4 minutes—or extend up to 15–30 minutes when ranges widen. Sergius emphasizes entering as close to the stop as possible. A tight entry improves the risk/reward ratio dramatically, turning a 1:3 scenario into a 1:6.  


## **Final Thoughts**

Sergius’ strategy is built on clarity and precision enabled by combining the cumulative volume from [Smartflow (SF) and Momoflow (Momo)](/indicators-and-features/Understanding SmartFlow and MomoFlow Indicators/) with a more traditional ORB strategy. Scan early for unusual volume, use signals in cumulative SF and Momo volume to time your entries and for confirmations. This disciplined approach gives you insight into what larger funds are doing and leads to a significant edge.
