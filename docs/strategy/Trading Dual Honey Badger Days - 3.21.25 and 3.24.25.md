BigShort warned its users of a [Honey BadgerISH Day](https://help.bigshort.com/en/articles/10279943-what-is-a-honey-badger-day-and-how-to-trade-it) leading up to March 20th 2025 and then a full [Honey Badger Day](https://help.bigshort.com/en/articles/10279943-what-is-a-honey-badger-day-and-how-to-trade-it) on March 24th 2025. Per usual, it turned out to be very lucrative.
