# Applying BigShort’s Indicators to Trade Profitably

## **Midday Short**

  * Traders paying attention to price action (like they should be) saw a classic double bottom pattern over the course of the morning and their bullish TA was telling them to make a long play.

  * But BigShort users knew better.

  * Bearish [Dark Pools](/docs/indicators-and-features/Understanding Dark Pools and DarkFlow in BigShort/) (DPs) had been appearing throughout the morning. Remember, when DPs appear above the public price, they usually act as resistance and often push the price down (bearish)

  * Net Option Flow Accumulation ([NOFA](/docs/indicators-and-features/Net Option Flow A Complete Guide/)) had also been steadily decreasing all morning (bearish).

  * Then the large NOF spike of put buying starting at noon created confluence with the DPs that price is not likely to continue rising (bearish).

  * **Execution:** Traders could have, at the very least, protected their capital by avoiding a long play based on the TA. Even better, BigShort users could be confident in a midday short play based on the indicators and made money where others were getting wrecked.


* * *
