## Introduction

BigShort empowers you to trade support breakout setups with precision. By leveraging advanced tools like [DarkPools](/indicators-and-features/Understanding Dark Pools and DarkFlow in BigShort/), [MomoFlow](/indicators-and-features/Understanding SmartFlow and MomoFlow Indicators/), and [Net Option Flow (NOF)](/indicators-and-features/Net Option Flow A Complete Guide/), you can identify when a key support level will hold strong and propel the price upward. This guide explains how to spot these setups and trade them with confidence.  
  


## What Is a Support Breakout Trade?

A support breakout trade occurs when the price tests a significant support level and then bounces higher rather than breaking down. In this scenario, the support level—established by previous price action—holds firm, signaling strong underlying demand. When the price reverses upward from this level, it indicates that buyers are stepping in, often leading to a traceable, sustained move higher.

  


## How to Identify the Setup – Support Breakout

**Draw the Support Line**

Identify a key support level by marking previous lows where buyers stepped in. This level acts as a floor for price action.  


**Monitor the Price Action**

Observe how the price behaves as it approaches support. A period of consolidation or a brief dip followed by a strong bullish candlestick can indicate that the support is holding.  


**Look for Bullish Candlestick Formations**

A strong bullish candle (or a series of them) forming on or near support suggests that buyers are overpowering sellers. This is your first clue that a support breakout trade may be forming.

Together, these tools alert you to the strength of the support level and the size of the bounce before the breakout fully unfolds, allowing traders to get in before the bounce.  
  


## How to Trade the Setup

**Entry Point**

Enter the trade once the price confirms a bounce off the support level. Look for a bullish candlestick formation accompanied by strong BigShort signals outlined above.  


**Stop-Loss Placement**

Manage your risk by placing a stop-loss just below the support level. This protects your position in case the support fails and the price reverses downward.

  
**Profit Target**

Set an initial profit target by measuring the distance from the support level to recent resistance. As institutional indicators remain favorable, consider staying in the trade longer to capture an extended move.
