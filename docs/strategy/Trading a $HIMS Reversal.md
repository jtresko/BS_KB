A note to up your game:

  * SmartFlow can be manipulative and manipulated. Be careful to trade confluences and understand the role of each indicator.

  * Momo is often NOT an inverse indicator when stocks are lead by retail or after major news like earnings. Be vigilant in watching Momo and get to know your tickers really well before trading big money.
