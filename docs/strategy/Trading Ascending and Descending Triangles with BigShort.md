# What Is a Triangle Breakout?

Triangle patterns form as the price consolidates between converging trendlines. An ascending triangle indicates bullish pressure, while a descending triangle suggests bearish pressure. A breakout from these triangles often leads to a large price move that can be traded.

# **How to Identify the Setup - Ascending Triangle**

## **Draw the Trendlines**

Identify converging trendlines to form the triangle.  


## **Note the horizontal**

An Ascending Triangle is formed from a horizontal top and ascending bottom connecting the higher lower. This is critical and differentiates the ascending triangle from the bearish rising wedge pattern

## **Monitor the Squeeze**

The Dark Pools signify off market trades below the price and are strong bullish signals when in groups or when they are large.
