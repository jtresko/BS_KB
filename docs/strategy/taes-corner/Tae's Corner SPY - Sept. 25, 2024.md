In Tae's corner, we share small snap shots of advice and wisdom from BigShort's founder, Tae, that he often shares in the Tutoring channel of our [Discord community.](/discord-community/How to Join our Members-Only Discord Channels/)  
  
The setup discussed below is SPY on the [Smart Flow tab](/getting-started/platform-tabs/SmartFlow Tab/) in BigShort and was [shared on the Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1098243246699860018/1248083166028238949/1288592393267839050) on September 25th 2024.

**Bearish Net Options Sets the Tone** : Aggressive [Net Options ](/indicators-and-features/Net Option Flow A Complete Guide/)put buying (and moderate call selling) at the open predicted a bearish turn for the day (purple oval in the image below).

**Momentum "Momo" Predicts the Move** : Bearish [Shadow Bars](/indicators-and-features/Understanding SmartFlow and MomoFlow Indicators/) from the retail traders ("[Momo](/indicators-and-features/Understanding SmartFlow and MomoFlow Indicators/)" to BigShort traders) in the first minutes of the trading day predicted an imminent ~15 minute downward thrust (red oval, below).

About 40 minutes later, a large bullish [Shadow Bar](/indicators-and-features/Understanding SmartFlow and MomoFlow Indicators/) predicts an immediate ~10 min bullish thrust (red box, above).

**Mid-day Bearish Signals** : In the afternoon, [Dark Pools](/indicators-and-features/Understanding Dark Pools and DarkFlow in BigShort/) (DPs) showed up above the price and gave traders a few min to plan for a huge bearish move (blue oval, below)

A large bearish [shadow bar](/indicators-and-features/Understanding SmartFlow and MomoFlow Indicators/) by the [Momentum traders](/indicators-and-features/Understanding SmartFlow and MomoFlow Indicators/) gave BigShort traders even more confidence before the drop (red box, above)   
  
**DPs Set The New Top** : Numerous and sizable Dark Pools (DPs) emerge to set the new top for the remainder of the day and suppress the price (blue oval, below).
