**Morning Market Activity** : A significant amount of momentum buying ([Momo](/indicators-and-features/Understanding SmartFlow and MomoFlow Indicators/)) occurred in the morning but was faded by market makers. This led to a dip, during which Momo oversold, triggering a rally.

**Market Sentiment** : Despite the rally, Momo did not regain confidence and continued selling throughout the day, causing prices to rise further.

**User Insights** : BigShort users avoided shorting at the top of the range due to bullish signals, supported by [Dark Pools](/indicators-and-features/Understanding Dark Pools and DarkFlow in BigShort/) (DPs) during the rally and breakout.

**Market Flow Observations** : Momoflow was significantly larger than [Net Option Flow](/indicators-and-features/Net Option Flow A Complete Guide/) (NOF), which remained relatively flat and had minimal impact.
