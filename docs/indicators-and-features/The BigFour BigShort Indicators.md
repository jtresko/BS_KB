# The BigFour BigShort Indicators

You will often see BigShort traders talk about the "BigFour" or main BigShort indicators. While BigShort offers dozens of different datapoints to help you trade, the BigFour are critical to learn and master.

## The BigFour

### 1. Dark Pools

Off-market trades that reveal where institutional money is positioning. Dark pool prints on the chart show support and resistance levels.

### 2. Net Option Flow (NOF)

The net dollar-weighted flow of options buying and selling. NOF shows whether more money is flowing into bullish or bearish positions.

### 3. MomoFlow (and Shadow Bars)

Momentum traders like retail or non-algorithmic institutional money. MomoFlow is an **inverse indicator** - when momo dumps, market makers are buying.

### 4. SmartFlow

## Using the BigFour Together

The key to successful trading with BigShort is looking for **confluence** - when multiple indicators align in the same direction. 

**Bullish confluence example:**
- Dark pools clustered below current price (support)
- NOF trending positive (bullish options flow)
- MomoFlow shadow bars pointing down (momo selling, MMs buying)
- SmartFlow positive (smart money accumulating)

When all four indicators align, you have a high-probability setup. When they conflict, exercise caution.

💡 **Tip:** Start by mastering one or two indicators before trying to use all four. Most new traders begin with Dark Pools and MomoFlow Shadow Bars.
