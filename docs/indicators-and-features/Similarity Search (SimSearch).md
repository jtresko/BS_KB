# The Science Behind Similarity Search

Our approach is rooted in the understanding that market behavior often reflects human emotional patterns. We all wake up at the same time, eat lunch at the same time, get tired at the same time, etc. And just like our daily routines follow predictable rhythms, stock prices fluctuate in recognizable waves. This is why intraday studies are useful, and Similarity Search translates these emotional currents into actionable data.

In the BigShort app, click on [UltraFlow](/getting-started/platform-tabs/Understanding the UltraFlow Tab/) in the side menu. From there, choose which UltraFlow you’d like to view at the top left of the screen under the date search. From there, click the Similarity Search (beta) button next to the historical button. At the bottom of the BigShort chart, you’ll now see the 5 dates with the most similar price patterns to today’s, as well as the SS median line, which is the median of all 5 days. Click on the dates to toggle them on and off.
