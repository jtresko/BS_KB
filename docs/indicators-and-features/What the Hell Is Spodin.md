# What is Spodin?

Spodin (short for Spear of Odin) is our proprietary closed-system alert; with it, you can set personalized price alerts that are sent directly to your phone via call or text when specific price levels are reached. By using Spodin, you can rest assured that your price alerts remain confidential and secure, which eliminates the risk of your trading intentions being exploited by market makers.  


# How to Access Spodin

In the BigShort app, click on Spodin in the side menu.

# How to Reset a Spodin

When the price target of the Spodin is hit, you'll receive a call/text to the phone number you added. The triggered Spodin will be highlighted in teal, and will not alert you again. You can choose to reset the Spodin, meaning you'll receive another call/text when that price is hit, by selecting "Reset" under Options.
