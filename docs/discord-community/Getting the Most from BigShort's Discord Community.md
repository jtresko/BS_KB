# Introduction

If you are already a BigShort customer and you have not yet joined our members-only discord community, stop what you are doing and [follow these steps](https://intercom.help/bigshort/en/articles/10372185-how-to-join-our-members-only-discord-channels) immediately.

In our private Discord channels, you’ll connect with hundreds of traders—ranging from beginners to seasoned pros—sharing insights, strategies, and even the occasional humble brag. It’s a vibrant space to learn, trade, and grow together.

Trading might seem like a solitary activity—one person, a screen, and a sea of data. But the truth is, the most successful traders rarely go it alone. On trading floors, collaboration is key. Ideas flow, strategies are refined, and support is ever-present. That’s the essence of our community.

# Channels

Feeling a bit daunted by the chats in Discord? Don’t worry—we’ve got you covered. Here’s a breakdown of our key channels to help you find your way:

## **Market Chat**

Dive into discussions about the market as a whole. Topics here often include macroeconomic events, market trends, and how external factors impact trading. This is the place to zoom out and consider the big picture as well as zooming in to look at how BigShort helps understand these factors.

## **Day Trade**

If fast-paced action is your style, this channel is for you. Day traders and scalpers discuss intraday movements, often posting trades that last mere minutes—or even seconds.

## **Swing Trade**

This channel is geared toward swing traders who focus on longer-term trades than day traders. Discussions here include strategies and analyses for trades that span days or weeks.

## **4\. Official Tae Recs**

Get exclusive insights and recommendations from Tae, the mastermind behind BigShort. From actionable advice to trading wisdom, this channel is a goldmine of valuable content.
