**To go even further:** If you have [GPT Tasks](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10291617-scheduled-tasks-in-chatgpt), an industrious person might consider picking their favorite from the above and getting an automated update whenever they publish a new trade, then diving into BigShort for timing that entry...  
  


**Cautionary Note from the AI** : Politicians’ reported “returns” are tricky to calculate precisely since they may not disclose exact purchase and sale prices in real time. The above figures use approximate date ranges and trade volumes from publicly filed reports. Always cross-check the raw disclosures for the most accurate picture.

  
**Important Disclaimer, also from the AI** : The figures above are illustrative, approximate, and based on aggregations of publicly available self-reported or third-party-tracked disclosures. Political trading data is notorious for inconsistencies and reporting lags. For any final decisions, verify through primary sources such as the Clerk of the House/Senate disclosure databases or reputable aggregation services (e.g. unusualwhales.com, capitoltrades.com).
