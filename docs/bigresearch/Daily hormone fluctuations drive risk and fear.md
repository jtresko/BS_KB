[SimSearch](/docs/indicators-and-features/Similarity Search (SimSearch)/) is BigShort's daily performance prediction graph, generated dynamically each day. SimSearch and other BigShort indicators work because human decision making and performance are strongly influenced by hormones in predictable ways. This fact drives patterns in human reaction to various scenarios, which give rise to stock market patterns.  
  
Below we've gathered and summarized the research so you can up your trading results in no time.

Research suggests traders’ hormone levels swing throughout the day, influencing everything from aggression and confidence to fear and risk aversion. [Early-morning spikes of testosterone and cortisol ](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0704025105)can fuel bold moves or anxious selloffs, while mid-day lulls and late-day surges in [other brain chemicals may nudge traders between caution and impulsivity](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2018.00101/full). By mapping these physiological patterns, day and swing traders may gain an edge – or at least avoid being blindsided by their own biology.

# **TESTOSTERONE: FUEL FOR MORNING CONFIDENCE AND RISK**

Let’s start with the “confidence hormone.” Testosterone tends to peak in the early morning. Researchers such as Coates and Herbert have noted, “Testosterone in male athletes… will rise prior to a competition and rise even further in a winning athlete,” a phenomenon they call the “winner effect.” In financial contexts, the same pattern appears: “Daily testosterone levels were significantly higher on days when traders made more than their one-month daily average than on other days.” This hormonal surge can improve performance short-term by boosting confidence, but too much testosterone may prompt excessive risk-taking. As Herbert once wrote, “Too much testosterone can have a detrimental effect on the ability to assess risk rationally.”

Morning markets often see big bursts of trading volume and volatility. Part of that is habit and market structure, but biology may also play a role. Success early in the day can ramp up testosterone further, reinforcing a risk-on attitude that persists for hours. However, a steep loss or burst of fear can suppress testosterone, dampening aggression.

# **CORTISOL: STRESS HORMONE BEHIND FEAR AND CAUTION**

Cortisol is the body’s main stress hormone – it soars in moments of uncertainty or threat. A field study of London traders found cortisol levels rose 68% over a two-week period of high market volatility. One researcher concluded, “Cortisol responds to economic uncertainty,” helping the body react quickly to perceived crisis. Initially, that might sharpen awareness. Over time, though, elevated cortisol breeds caution, anxiety, and “risk aversion.”

In one experiment highlighted by a University of Cambridge release, participants were given cortisol over several days to mimic chronic stress. The outcome: “Chronically high and sustained levels… led to a dramatic drop in participants’ willingness to take risks, with the ‘risk premium’… falling by 44%.” This explains why a string of losses or prolonged market chaos can make traders sell prematurely or avoid opportunities. Cortisol hits the brakes on risk-taking, and if it stays high too long, it saps focus and clarity too.

# **DOPAMINE: REWARD RUSHES AND IMPULSIVE TRADES**

Dopamine is the brain’s “reward” neurotransmitter, surging when we anticipate or receive something pleasant. It’s the rush you get before clicking “buy” on a promising trade. One study on the genetics of traders found that extreme highs or lows in dopamine activity correlated with erratic risk-taking behavior. Researchers reported that “Pharmacological modulation of the dopamine system has been shown to increase financial risk taking,” linking the chemical directly to bigger bets.

While dopamine can energize a trader to seize an opportunity, it’s also behind gambling-like behavior. After a big win, dopamine spikes can lure traders into doubling down or chasing the same thrill. Conversely, someone with too little dopamine might struggle to pull the trigger on even valid setups. The most consistent performers seem to have a balanced dopamine response, motivated but not manic.

# **SEROTONIN: MOOD, PATIENCE, AND LOGIC UNDER PRESSURE**

Serotonin stabilizes mood, curbs impulsivity, and promotes a sense of well-being. Though less studied in finance than testosterone or cortisol, its influence is critical. In a famous neuroscience experiment, lowering serotonin in monkeys “decreased preference for the safe option in a gambling task,” making them impulsive risk-takers. Humans show a similar effect – low serotonin can lead to impatience and emotionally driven decisions.

Traders low on sleep or proper nutrition likely have dips in serotonin, which may explain those days when everything feels irritating or rushed. By contrast, healthy serotonin levels align with calmer, more deliberative behavior: you weigh pros and cons, follow the trading plan, and avoid revenge-trading after a loss. It’s the steadying force that helps keep emotions in check.

# **DAILY RHYTHMS AND TRADING PATTERNS**

Our hormones don’t stand still; they follow natural circadian or “around the clock” rhythms. Cortisol typically spikes shortly after waking, then tapers off by midday. Testosterone is also higher in the morning, though it can fluctuate more subtly. At market open, many traders are quite literally at a physiological peak for alertness and aggression. This helps explain the classic opening-bell volatility and that early adrenaline rush.

By midday, cortisol dips, and testosterone often levels out. This mid-day lull can encourage calmer, more analytical decision-making – or, for some, a slump in energy that prompts fewer trades. As the day nears its end, deadlines and the closing bell can nudge cortisol back up, sparking a final hour of anxious position-closing or bold attempts to lock in gains. If you’ve had a good run, you may feel a dopamine-fueled desire to push your luck. If you’ve taken hits, cortisol might be driving you to retreat.

# **PRACTICAL TRADING TAKEAWAYS**

  * **Track Your Highs and Lows** : Recognize when morning testosterone might make you overconfident or when rising stress might trigger excessive caution.

  * **Time Your Critical Decisions** : If possible, schedule important analyses or trades when your mind (and hormones) are relatively calm – often mid-morning or midday.

  * **Manage “Winner” and “Loser” Effects** : A big win can ramp up testosterone and dopamine, making you reckless. A streak of losses elevates cortisol, making you fearful. Take short breaks to reset emotionally.

  * **Align with Natural Energy Cycles** : The opening bell may be your best window for decisive action if you can harness morning momentum without succumbing to bravado.

  * **Healthy Lifestyle, Healthy Hormones** : Good sleep, a balanced diet, regular exercise, and stress-management techniques help regulate testosterone, cortisol, dopamine, and serotonin. That steadier chemistry promotes clearer thinking.

# **CONCLUSION**

Hormones may be invisible, but they wield real influence over traders’ decisions. Testosterone can supercharge confidence and risk-taking, cortisol can push you to fight or flee, dopamine can spark both motivation and recklessness, and serotonin is the unsung hero of rational calm. By recognizing these fluctuating forces, day and swing traders can better avoid emotional extremes. A simple awareness of when biology is nudging you can help you time trades, maintain discipline, and stay in control. In short, mastering the markets may also require mastering your internal chemistry – and riding the hormonal rollercoaster with eyes wide open.
