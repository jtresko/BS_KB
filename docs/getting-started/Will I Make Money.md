Many of our users consistently make thousands of dollars per day using BigShort. Some make even more. This includes a few traders who started with little to no trading experience before using our product. That said, if you’re completely new to trading, BigShort may not be the right fit for you just yet.

BigShort isn't an easy get-rich-quick scheme. I'is a tool designed for traders who already understand basic chart patterns, are dissatisfied with conventional indicators, and want to gain an edge with BigShort’s leading indicators. Successful trading takes time, skill, and discipline, and BigShort is built to help experienced traders maximize their potential—not to guarantee results.

❗**Friendly Reminder:** Any software, tool, course, or dude on Instagram who claims to have an easy path to guaranteed profits or a system that takes no effort is a _scam_. Run from them as fast as you can.

If you’re new to trading, we recommend starting with tools like [ChartGame.com](https://www.chartgame.com). It’s free and lets you practice trading in a risk-free environment.
