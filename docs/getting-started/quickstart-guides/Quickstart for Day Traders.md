Day Traders Quick Start   
  


## **Follow OFFICIAL Tae Recs for day trades**

  
100% track record so far.   
  
Tae makes them as they arise, in the [Official-Tae-Recs Discord Channel](https://discord.com/channels/1098243246699860018/1164738837843550230) about 12 times per year. This requires that you [sign up for the subscribers-only discord](/discord-community/How to Join our Members-Only Discord Channels/) which is included free with your subscription to BigShort.  
  
Many of these recs take weeks or months to play out and are squarely Swing Trades, so take the ones that work on the daily timeframe. The return is often 100% or more on these trades.   
  
**Difficulty - Easiest.** No special training is needed in advance of these trades.  
  
**Preparation - None.** No preparation need be completed before these trades besides being a BigShort user who is logged into the Subscribers-only Discord.  
  


##   
**Trade every Honey Badger (and Badgerish) Day**

  
90% success rate.   
  
[Honey Badger Days](/strategy/What is a Honey Badger Day and How To Trade It/) occur about six times per year. Often user return more than the annual subscription to BigShort on one Honey Badger Day.   
  
**Difficulty - Easy.** Users must use some minimal discretion about when to enter the trade at the beginning of the day.   
  
**Preparation - Light.** Users must read [one simple set of instructions](/strategy/What is a Honey Badger Day and How To Trade It/) and one visual beforehand ([like the visual shared here](/strategy/trading-walkthroughs/Trading Dual Honey Badger Days - 3.21.25 and 3.24.25/)).  
  
  


### **Check Top 10 Short Exempt (SE) on the Dashboard for Tickers with an indicator over 1**

A [high Short Exempt (SE) indicator over 1 ](/indicators-and-features/What is Short Exempt (SE)/)on[ the Dashboard](/getting-started/platform-tabs/Dashboard & Top 10s/) implies high volatility in the coming day(s) for that ticker. Use the BigFour BigShort indicators to trade that stock.

**Difficulty - Moderate.** Users must know how all [BigFour BigShort indicators](/indicators-and-features/The BigFour BigShort Indicators/) work and be patient enough to wait for agreement. Users must use their own discretion as to how much signal is enough for them to enter

**Preparation - Moderate.** Users must read and be comfortable with the workings of the BigFour BigShort Indicators - [Dark Pools](/indicators-and-features/Understanding Dark Pools and DarkFlow in BigShort/), [NOF](/indicators-and-features/Net Option Flow A Complete Guide/), [Momo, and SmartFlow](/indicators-and-features/Understanding SmartFlow and MomoFlow Indicators/).
