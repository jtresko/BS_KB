💡**Tip:** A condensed version of this OptionFlow data can also be viewed on the SmartFlow or SF Segregated tabs by clicking the "Options Details" button from the options above the price chart. 

# Looking Around

As with other sections of the software, you can select any ticker and date in the upper left part of the page. 

The table will then show you all large and unusual option activity for that ticker. In addition to traditional info about the options, every trade is also analyzed by our system for sentiment and can be assigned: bullish, bearish, or no sentiment. This is done via proprietary BigShort algorithms and can be used to help you understand what these options trades might be indicating about the market sentiment of the stock.

For users who want to dig a little deeper, there are some filtering options in the upper right hand corner of the page, like the ability to show only flows that expire within a month of today's date.
