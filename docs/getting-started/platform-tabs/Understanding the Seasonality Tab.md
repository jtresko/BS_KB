# **What Does the Seasonality Tab Show?**

  1. **Calendar Date Performance** :

     * The top chart displays SPY's historical performance for each calendar date over the past 30 years.

     * Key metrics include:

       * **Average Return** : The average price change for SPY on that specific date.

       * **Percent Positive** : The percentage of years SPY closed higher on that date.  


  2. **Day of the Week Performance** :

     * The bottom chart on the Seasonality tab summarizes the historical performance of SPY based on the day of the week (Monday through Friday).

     * Metrics include:

       * **Average Return** : How SPY has historically performed on each day of the week.

       * **Percent Positive** : The likelihood of SPY closing higher on each weekday.  



# **How to Use the Seasonality Tab**

  1. **Pre-Market Planning** :

     * Before the trading day starts (or even the day prior), use the Seasonality tab to gain a **directional bias** for the day.

     * For example, **November 24th** is historically one of the most bullish trading days of the year, with:

       * **83% Positive Close** : SPY has closed higher 83% of the time on this date.

       * **+0.73% Average Return** : SPY has averaged a 0.73% increase on this date historically.  


  2. **Adding Context to Your Trades** :

     * Seasonality is a **weaker force** in the market compared to real-time indicators, but it can help frame your strategy.

     * Use it as an additional layer of analysis alongside tools like [SmartFlow](/indicators-and-features/Understanding SmartFlow and MomoFlow Indicators/), [Dark Pools](/indicators-and-features/Understanding Dark Pools and DarkFlow in BigShort/), and other proprietary BigShort indicators.


# **Pro Tips for Using Seasonality**

  * **Look for Confluence** : Combine seasonality trends with other market indicators to build a stronger case for your trades.  


  * **Identify Key Dates** : Use the calendar date performance chart to spot historically bullish or bearish days.  


  * **Weekday Patterns** : Use the day-of-week chart to identify recurring trends, such as whether Mondays or Fridays tend to perform better or worse.
