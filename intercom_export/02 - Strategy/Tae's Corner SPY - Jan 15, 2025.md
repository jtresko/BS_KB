**Morning Market Activity** : A significant amount of momentum buying ([Momo](https://intercom.help/bigshort/en/articles/10361455-understanding-smartflow-and-momoflow-indicators)) occurred in the morning but was faded by market makers. This led to a dip, during which Momo oversold, triggering a rally.

**Market Sentiment** : Despite the rally, Momo did not regain confidence and continued selling throughout the day, causing prices to rise further.

**User Insights** : BigShort users avoided shorting at the top of the range due to bullish signals, supported by [Dark Pools](https://intercom.help/bigshort/en/articles/10280483-understanding-dark-pools-and-darkflow-in-bigshort) (DPs) during the rally and breakout.

**Market Flow Observations** : Momoflow was significantly larger than [Net Option Flow](https://intercom.help/bigshort/en/articles/10354751-net-option-flow-a-complete-guide) (NOF), which remained relatively flat and had minimal impact.
