Today we're going to learn about how to trade using the [Short Exempt](https://help.bigshort.com/en/articles/10629795-what-is-short-exempt-se) indicators on BigShort. For swing traders in particular, this signal can mean the difference between financial independence or leaving your day job, and fighting for profitability.  
​  
This trade starts on the [Dashboard tab](https://intercom.help/bigshort/en/articles/10362240-dashboard-top-10s) in BigShort (yellow box, below). Look for Top 10 SE (blue box, below):

On top of the blue box we see "Top 10 SE" showing us the top 10 with the highest short exempt volume as of the last update. On the bottom of the blue box we see the cumulative trailing 10 days of short exempt volume.   
​  
Zooming in a bit, this means SOUN was the most short exempt stock as of the last update which you can see in the greenish box was 2.16.2025 @ 4:28am EST. Always check the date here.

Now that we've indentified that SOUN was the most short exempt stock as of Sunday 16th, we can explore this further via the Short Volume tab (blue box), by checking the Short Exempt box (yellow box), and by entering SOUN in the ticker search box (red box):

We can see that this short exempt volume (~6M) is the highest for this ticker in many months (purple bar within the purple oval, above.

  
Seeing this, BigShort swing traders know that there is likely a big move coming.   
​

Below we see today's move (Monday was a holiday, so this is the first day since the SE candle flashed). The SE predicted a +12.3% move in the first 90 minutes of the day (one our founder Tae was waiting for thanks to SE).
