In our User Strategies series, we share unique and interesting trading strategies from [the BigShort Discord](https://discord.com/invite/6w22gAVzMB) by BigShort traders. They often find novel ways to use, combine, and explain using BigShort indicators to consistently win.

This strategy focuses on spotting when a strong momentum move loses steam—a setup that BigShort trader (and Founder!) Tae calls "exhaustion reversal". This setup is noticed on the [SF Segregated](https://intercom.help/bigshort/en/articles/10362301-sf-segregated-tab) tab, for users who want to replicate it.

## **Identify the Setup**

Watch for a powerful move in one direction. When [momentum](https://intercom.help/bigshort/en/articles/10361455-understanding-smartflow-and-momoflow-indicators) finally flips (below, pink), expect a sizeable bounce in the next couple of candles.   
​

Important: While the flip candle often provides a quick scalp opportunity, timing and consistency matter. For the flip signal to be reliable, multi-candle Momo trends are required.  
​

## **Read the Institutional Imprint**

Institutions can dominate volume for extended periods. For example, an hour-long series of block sell orders creates pressure. When these orders stop, the supply/demand ratio shifts quickly, triggering a reversal. Conversely, heavy morning buying that suddenly stops can force a sharp price drop.

Use the correct indicator! - The reversal is best detected using [Shadow Bars](https://intercom.help/bigshort/en/articles/10361455-understanding-smartflow-and-momoflow-indicators). These are most easily viewed on the SF segregated tab. Shadow bars capture the volume dynamics behind the exhaustion effect, revealing when non-algorithmic trading pressure is fading.

## **Execute with Precision**

Enter on the flip candle (below, pink), but stay alert. Market makers might briefly push the price in the opposite direction to accumulate shares before the reversal completes. Act quickly and keep your risk tight.

##   
**Final Thoughts**

The exhaustion reversal signal leverages BigShort's ability to track institutional trading. Spot a strong directional move, watch for the flip, and use Momoflow to confirm the setup. Master this, and you’ll capture quick scalps when the market shifts.
