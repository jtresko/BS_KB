# **Overview**

BigShort trader Zedamonator's “3 Bar Reversal” is a price action strategy enhanced by BigShort’s [Momo "Shadow Bars"](https://help.bigshort.com/en/articles/10361455-understanding-smartflow-and-momoflow-indicators) indicator, designed to identify high-probability entries by anticipating retail trader stop-loss hunts by market makers. It works best in combination with overall trend awareness, offering opportunities both with and counter to prevailing trends.

# **How to Trade the 3 Bar Reversal**

## **Identify the Trend**

  * Determine if the market is in a clear bullish, bearish, or range-bound state.

  * Strategy effectiveness:

    * **Best (A+ Setup):** Trading in the direction of the existing trend after a pullback.

    * **Moderate (B/C Setup):** Counter-trend reversals, timing pullbacks.




## **Watch Momo's Shadow Bars**

  * Shadow Bars reveal the behavior of retail traders (“MOMO”) versus institutional traders (“[Smart Money](https://help.bigshort.com/en/articles/10361455-understanding-smartflow-and-momoflow-indicators)” & “Market Makers”).

  * Look for Shadow Bars pointing opposite the direction you want to trade (note: these are reversed after a long break or weekend):

    * **Bullish trend:** Look for down-pointing Shadow Bars to enter longs.

    * **Bearish trend:** Look for up-pointing Shadow Bars to enter shorts.




##  **Spotting the 3 Bar Reversal Pattern**

  * Requires at least **two consecutive bars** in the same direction (e.g., two green bars in an uptrend).

  * The **third bar must break below the low** of the previous green bar (in an uptrend) or above the high of the previous red bar (in a downtrend).

  * Example (Uptrend short reversal):

    * Bar 1: Green bullish candle.

    * Bar 2: Green bullish candle.

    * Bar 3: Red candle breaks below Bar 2’s low.




## **Entry Criteria (for optimal trade execution)**

  * Confirm these conditions before entry:

    * **Break of prior bar’s low/high:** Clearly breaking previous bar’s extreme signals reversal.

    * **Shadow Bar pointing toward retail traders’ direction:** Indicates retail traders are trapped, setting up a stop-loss run.

    * E**nter at the break point:** Execute trade precisely as the previous bar’s low/high is broken.




## **Trade Management**

  * Ideal for quick scalps; lock in profits promptly. Zeda says in the Discord "Once it is broken then we short and cover whenever you want".

  * Particularly effective on **range days** but still viable during trending markets (use EMA 20 as additional confirmation for trend-following trades).

"Here is a step by step process,   
1.) Market is going up...lots of green bars   
2.) Up shadow bars appear in BS meaning momo is hopping in on the trend.   
3.) Decide we want to short.   
4.) The first purple horizontal line is where we want to short because it means the low of the last green candle gets broken (also where retail might put their trailing stop)   
5.) Once it is broken then we short and cover whenever you want. Sometimes you can hold for a long time or a down shadow bar but it's up to you. I usually just scalp but it also depends on if it's a range/trend day.

# **Advanced Thoughts and Tips from Zeda**

  * Don’t rely solely on Shadow Bars; **always confirm with price action**.

  * Wait patiently for the 3 bar reversal to confirm entries clearly instead of immediately jumping in on Shadow Bars.

  * This strategy focuses on aligning your trade with the institutional “winning team,” increasing probabilities by capitalizing on retail traders’ predictable mistakes.

  * To avoid fake-outs, consider briefly checking a higher timeframe (e.g., 15-minute) for additional confirmation.




  
​ 

# **Ideal Use Cases**

  * Futures trading (ES/MES) and highly liquid assets like SPY.

  * Scalping and short-term trades aiming for high accuracy and lower-risk setups.
