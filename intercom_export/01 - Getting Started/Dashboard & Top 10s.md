💡 **Tip:** Each ticker is clickable and will take you directly to the SmartFlow tab for that ticker so you can dive in to further analysis.

# Center Column

The center column displays the 10 tickers with the largest positive [SmartFlow](https://intercom.help/bigshort/en/articles/10361455-understanding-smartflow-and-momoflow-indicators) (SF) that day and the 10 tickers with largest negative SF. Each ticker is also clickable.

# Right Column

The right column can be set to the user's preference by clicking the gear in the upper right corner of each pane. There are two options.

## Top 10 Short Exempt

The top list shows the 10 tickers with the highest short exempt activity, and exciting new indicator that can help traders predict imminent run ups. The tickers are ranked by the ratio of _Short Exempt_ to S _hares Outstandin_ g.

The bottom list shows the 10 tickers with the highest short exempt activity over the preceding 10 trading days. This gives traders a quick view on extended short exempt activity and helps identify newcomers to the upper list.

## Top 10 Manipulation

Using the gear icon, users can switch to view the top 10 tickers by their amount of [manipulation](https://intercom.help/bigshort/en/articles/10444514-manipulation-and-market-maker-price-discovery) in the positive direction (upper list) or negative direction (lower list).
