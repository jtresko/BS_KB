Swing Traders Quick Start Steps

##   
**Follow OFFICIAL Tae Recs for swing trades**

  
100% track record so far.   
​  
Tae makes them as they arise, in the [Official-Tae-Recs Discord Channel](https://discord.com/channels/1098243246699860018/1164738837843550230) about 12 times per year. This requires that you [sign up for the subscribers-only discord](https://help.bigshort.com/en/articles/10372185-how-to-join-our-members-only-discord-channels) which is included free with your subscription to BigShort.  
​  
Many of these recs take weeks or months to play out and are squarely Swing Trades. The return is often 100% or more on these trades.   
​  
​**Difficulty - Easiest.** No special training is needed in advance of these trades.  
​  
​**Preparation - None.** No preparation need be completed before these trades besides being a BigShort user who is logged into the Subscribers-only Discord and keeping an eye out for Tae's Recs.   
​  
We even have a Discord Bot (hoBOTae) that you can DM '!notify' to for automated updates from the Tae Recs channel. Couldn't be easier.  
​

## Check Top 10 Short Exempt (SE) Trailing 10 Days 

  
Checking the [Top 10 SE Trailing 10 Days list](https://help.bigshort.com/en/articles/10362240-dashboard-top-10s) on the Dashboard for significant, days-long spikes in SE in stocks you like in industries you like. Click into those stocks and look at them in [SF Segregated](https://help.bigshort.com/en/articles/10362301-sf-segregated-tab) on the daily timeframe. Buy if the price and [BigFour BigShort indicators](https://intercom.help/bigshort/en/articles/11002762-the-bigfour-bigshort-indicators) align and the market dynamics are bullish.  
​  
​**Difficulty - Advanced.** You need knowledge of the market dynamics, Price Trend, and BigShort Indicators

  
​**Preparation - Significant.** You need knowledge of the macro setup in addition to the ability to read BigShort indicators.   
​  
​  
​

## Combine high short exempt (SE) with NOF Signals and the Flows 

One of BigShort's best swing traders shared this setup that he uses. Using [SE](https://help.bigshort.com/en/articles/10629795-what-is-short-exempt-se) to identify the ticker and [NOF](https://help.bigshort.com/en/articles/10354751-net-option-flow-a-complete-guide) and [Flows](https://help.bigshort.com/en/articles/10361455-understanding-smartflow-and-momoflow-indicators) to Identify the entry.   
​  
​**Difficulty - Moderate.** You need to understand a couple basic BigShort Indicators and have patience  
​  
​**Preparation - Minimal.** If the SE and Flows align, you can take the trade.  
​  
Step by Step:

  * Wait for a contraction day that coincides with high SE days (Below, the yellow oval) for ticker SOUN on the [Short Exempt Tab](https://help.bigshort.com/en/articles/10629795-what-is-short-exempt-se). 

    * As described above, you can use the [Dashboard top 10 SE trailing](https://help.bigshort.com/en/articles/10362240-dashboard-top-10s) to simplify finding these tickers.

  * Then, breaking out of the previous day's highs, you enter the long swing trade (yellow horizontal line, above).   
​

  * Combine the above with flow signals for even clearer entries. See below, ticker SOUN on the daily timeframe in the SF Segregated Tab. Note the four days in the yellow circle that correspond to the High SE days in the Yellow Oval in the prior image.

  * Wait for the flows to flip with significant size to enter the swing. 

    * Below, again SOUN on the daily timeframe on SF Segregated tab. 

    * The Net Options Flow of the day moved hugely bullish (purple oval, below).

    * The Momo "shadow bar" flipped bullish too on the same day (red circle, below)

    * Giving you the entry for the trade that day (yellow arrow)

  * Using SE to identify the ticker and the [BigFour BigShort Indicators](https://intercom.help/bigshort/en/articles/11002762-the-bigfour-bigshort-indicators) like Momo and NOF to time the entries leads to big wins. In the above case, it led a very tradable 57% price increase over nine days.

## Look for agreement on all three various timeframes 

BigShort provides 5min, 1hour, and 1day timeframes. In each, you can see the [BigFour BigShort indicators](https://intercom.help/bigshort/en/articles/11002762-the-bigfour-bigshort-indicators). Waiting until the signs are bullish (or bearish) on all three timeframes provides excellent setups for Swing Traders, and it's extremely easy to execute.  
​  
Difficulty - Easy - You simply need look for bullish or bearish agreement across the timeframes.   
​  
Preparation - Minimal - You only need to know how to click between timeframes and identify when BigShort Indicators are bullish or bearish.  
​  
​
