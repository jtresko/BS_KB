While this time period can present opportunities, it’s not the ideal trading environment for most BigShort users, particularly those newer to the platform or trading in general. Here’s why we advise caution during power hour and why our proprietary indicators may not perform as effectively in this time frame.<br/>​</p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p> </p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-heading intercom-interblocks-align-left"><h1 id="h_dd4435351f">Why Power Hour Is Unique</h1></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-subheading intercom-interblocks-align-left"><h2 id="h_0a94ffa623">Institutional Influence</h2></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p>During power hour, large institutional investors and funds dominate the market as they adjust their positions for the day’s close.

The volatility during power hour can lead to sharp price movements that are difficult to predict and navigate.</p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p> </p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-subheading intercom-interblocks-align-left"><h2 id="h_1b3fb1a115">Dynamic Shifts</h2></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p>Indicators like those used in BigShort rely on patterns, momentum, and mean reversion. These metrics are influenced by typical trading behavior throughout the day. However, during power hour, the rules shift. The heavy institutional activity disrupts these patterns, making it challenging for indicators to provide reliable insights.<br/>​</p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-heading intercom-interblocks-align-left"><h1 id="h_9c20ce484f"><br/>Advice for BigShort Users</h1></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-unordered-nested-list"><ul><li><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p><b>Avoid Power Hour Unless Experienced</b>: We recommend that most users, especially those newer to trading or BigShort, avoid trading during power hour altogether.</p></div></li><li><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p><b>Exercise Extreme Caution</b>: If you choose to trade during power hour, understand that the environment is highly volatile.
