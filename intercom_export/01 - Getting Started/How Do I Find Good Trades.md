It will take you longer to read this explainer than to execute the strategy once you've learned it. 

Sometimes when you login to BigShort, you know what you want to trade. But what about the other times? You have some time, you want to make some money. But you’re not sure where to look. 

Here we share a tried and true way to screen for strong stock trades in 5 min or less. Let's get to it.  
​

💡**Tip:** First off, and this is important, we suggest **NOT** trading if there isn’t a clear trade to take. More money has been lost by bored traders than by almost any other method in history. Don’t force it. 

But before giving up for the day, BigShort makes it super easy to find other trading ideas you might have overlooked.

  * A list of the major options trades going on in the market right now

  * The ticker, the details, the size, the direction (bullish, neutral, or bearish)

  * Across the top, you'll also see a readout of the current state of the options market.




There is simply no better way to sift through large options activity in the stock market than the BigShort OptionsFlow tab.  
​  
Here you can quickly see what the big trading shops are up to, what stocks they're playing with, how aggressively, and, by clicking on the ticker, you can immediately dive deeper and identify if a trade is on.
