However, if cuts are sparked by recession fears, equities can initially wobble. <b>Bonds</b> typically surge in value when rates fall – long-term Treasury yields tend to peak before the first Fed cut and then decline further, lifting bond prices . In fact, bonds often do much of their rally <i>before</i> the Fed’s first cut, anticipating easier policy. <b>Commodities</b> see mixed effects: rate cuts that weaken the U.S. dollar can push <b>gold</b> higher as an inflation hedge and alternative asset (especially if recession risks rise) . <b>Oil</b> and industrial commodities may struggle if rate cuts coincide with an economic downturn (lower demand), but in a soft-landing scenario, cheaper credit can support commodity demand. <b>Forex:</b> Easing by the Fed usually pressures the <b>U.S. dollar</b> lower, as yield differentials vs. other currencies shrink. A weaker dollar can in turn bolster U.S. exporters and emerging markets, though currencies like the euro or yen will also depend on their own central bank policies. Overall, a Fed easing cycle often creates a more “risk-on” environment – benefiting stocks and credit – while boosting safe havens like Treasury bonds and gold in more severe downturns .</p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p><br/>​</p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-subheading intercom-interblocks-align-left"><h2 id="h_9e20591ce3"><b>Detailed Historical Comparison</b></h2></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p>Every Fed rate-cut cycle has its own drivers, but lessons from past episodes offer perspective on today’s outlook. Key comparisons include:</p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p>• <b>Early 1980s (Volcker Era):</b> Faced with double-digit inflation, Fed Chair Paul Volcker drove the fed funds rate to ~19-20% in 1981, inducing back-to-back recessions. Once inflation finally broke, the Fed slashed rates dramatically – by over <b>10 percentage points</b> in the 1980 and 1981-82 recessions . This “stop-go” cycle is a cautionary tale: cutting too soon (as in 1980) led to a resurgence of inflation and a second round of tightening. <b>Similarity to today:</b> High inflation was the initial trigger then and now. However, today’s inflation (peaking around 9% in 2022) is lower and falling without a severe recession (so far), making a Volcker-sized rate-cutting cycle (over 10% drop) unlikely absent a sharp downturn. The 1980s also underscore the risk of easing prematurely if inflation isn’t yet tamed.</p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p>• <b>2001 (Dot-Com Bust):</b> After a late-1990s boom, the Fed had raised rates to ~6.5% by 2000. The bursting of the tech bubble and the 2001 recession prompted an aggressive easing: the Fed cut rates by about <b>5 full percentage points</b> in one year (from 6.5% in late 2000 to ~1.75% by end-2001) . The easing continued to a 1% trough by 2003 to revive growth. <b>Similarity to today:</b> Like the late 1990s, the late 2010s/2021 period saw asset bubbles (tech stocks, crypto, etc.) and a rapid Fed hiking cycle into 2023. If a recession hits now, the Fed could follow the 2001 template with swift, deep cuts (several percentage points) to cushion the downturn. The key difference: inflation in 2001 was tame (~2-3%), whereas today’s inflation, while down from its peak, remains above target – potentially limiting how fast the Fed can slash rates unless the economy severely falters.</p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p>• <b>2008 (Global Financial Crisis):</b> In 2007, with inflation moderate (~3-4%) but mounting financial stress, the Fed shifted from a 5.25% peak rate to <b>near-zero within 16 months</b> amid the worst financial crisis in decades. The 2008-2009 cutting cycle (over <b>500 bps</b> of easing) was extraordinary, featuring emergency moves and liquidity programs as the banking system cratered. <b>Similarity to today:</b> A 2008-style scenario would require a severe financial or economic crisis. Today’s cycle began with some banking sector tremors (2023’s regional bank failures), but systemic risk has been contained so far. Unless a larger credit crisis or crash emerges, the current situation is not expected to mirror 2008’s extreme rate-cutting pace. That said, the <i>lesson</i> from 2008 is that when a crisis strikes, the Fed can and will cut to zero very quickly – an outside risk scenario to keep in mind.</p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p>• <b>2019 (Mid-Cycle Adjustment):</b> In 2018, the Fed’s rate peaked around 2.5% before growth worries (and trade war uncertainties) led to a “mid-cycle” easing. Starting in mid-2019, the Fed implemented <b>three quarter-point cuts (75 bps total)</b> , bringing rates down to ~1.75% by late 2019. This was done despite no recession at the time – an insurance cut strategy to prolong the expansion. <b>Similarity to today:</b> This cycle is perhaps the closest parallel if the U.S. achieves a <i>soft landing</i>. In both cases, the Fed raised rates quickly, then paused with inflation easing. If the economy avoids a serious downturn now, the Fed may opt for only modest, gradual cuts (perhaps 50–100 bps over a few meetings) to fine-tune policy, much like 2019 (or the mid-1990s soft landing in 1995 which saw only <b>25 bps</b> of easing ). Today’s Fed has even used the phrase “policy adjustment” to suggest any initial cuts would be cautious calibrations, not a rush to zero, if the economy remains resilient.</p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p> </p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p><b>Most Similar Cycle:</b> Barring an abrupt recession or crisis, <b>the current cycle most resembles a blend of the mid-1990s/2019 soft landing scenario</b>. Like those periods, inflation is coming down from a high, and the Fed may cautiously ease policy to sustain growth without reversing the disinflation trend. The Fed’s rapid hikes (5%+ in 2022-2023) are unprecedented in speed, but the absence (so far) of a deep recession or financial meltdown puts us closer to a <i>mid-cycle adjustment</i> playbook than to the full-blown recession easings of 2001 or 2008. In essence, the Fed today is trying to engineer a 1995-style outcome – a gentle rate-cutting phase that lowers rates a bit (perhaps a couple of percentage points) over a year or two , rather than a frantic slashing to zero. That said, history also warns that today’s unique mix of still-elevated core inflation and an inverted yield curve could yet tilt this cycle toward a recessionary outcome (like 2001). The Fed is attempting a rare feat – cooling inflation <b>without</b> a hard landing – which makes 2024-2025 something of a test between the soft-landing precedent of 1995/2019 and the harder landings of 1981 or 2001.</p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p><br/>​</p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-subheading intercom-interblocks-align-left"><h2 id="h_c4bff4f785"><b>Current Market Expectations vs. Reality</b></h2></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p> </p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p><b>Wall Street vs. the Fed – a gap in views.</b> Coming into 2025, markets and economists widely anticipated the Fed would begin cutting rates by mid to late 2025. Fed funds futures and analyst surveys had penciled in multiple cuts in the second half of 2025, totaling roughly 100–125 bps of easing by year-end 2025. In fact, a Reuters poll in September 2024 (just after the Fed’s first cut) showed most economists expected the Fed to follow up with quarter-point cuts at the November and December 2024 meetings – reaching a year-end policy rate around <b>4.25-4.50%</b>. This trajectory was slightly <i>less</i> aggressive than market pricing at that time (markets were betting on about 75 bps more cuts in 2024, versus 50 bps in the economist consensus) . By early 2025, the market’s baseline view coalesced that the Fed would trim rates by roughly another 100 bps in 2025, ending next year around the mid-3% range . For instance, futures in late 2024 implied a fed funds rate near <b>3.25-3.50% by end-2025</b>, which assumes a cumulative ~200 bps of cuts from the peak . In short, Wall Street’s consensus sees the Fed on a gentle cutting path proceeding through 2025, for a total reduction of about 2 percentage points.</p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p> </p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p><b>The Fed’s own guidance</b> has been more conservative. In the December 2024 Summary of Economic Projections, <b>Fed officials’ median forecast</b> was for only <b>0.50% of rate reduction in 2025</b> (i.e. just two quarter-point cuts) . Policymakers indicated they expect to hold rates “higher for longer” to ensure inflation is defeated – even after the initial cuts in late 2024. Notably, the Fed revised down its expected 2025 cuts from four (in earlier projections) to two, reflecting concerns that inflation could stay above target or that the economy may not warrant aggressive easing . This hawkish signal surprised markets: stocks sold off when the Fed implied fewer cuts ahead than investors had hoped . Fed Chair Jerome Powell has emphasized that the Fed <b>will not rush to cut rates</b> at the first sign of lower inflation – he wants “real progress” toward the 2% goal or clear evidence of labor market softening before easing more . In early 2025, Powell reiterated the Fed is in “no hurry” to cut, given a still-strong job market and lingering above-target inflation . This messaging suggests the Fed could pause its easing campaign for stretches, as it did by holding rates steady in early 2025 after the initial late-2024 cuts, to reassess the data.</p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p> </p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p><b>Who’s right?</b> Historically, the <b>market’s anticipation</b> of Fed pivots has sometimes been premature – but eventually correct in direction – while the <b>Fed’s forecasts</b> often underplay how much they’ll ease once the tide turns. For example, in mid-2007 the Fed did not foresee the need for drastic cuts, yet by late 2008 it had slashed rates to zero. Conversely, in 1995 the Fed delivered just the gentle cuts it had telegraphed, confounding any market hopes for a bigger reversal. In the current cycle, the truth may lie in between: The market expects about 200 bps of easing through 2025, whereas the Fed’s dot plot suggests only ~150 bps. If the economy avoids recession and inflation remains somewhat sticky, the Fed’s cautious stance (fewer cuts) will prove closer to reality – meaning market expectations of deeper cuts would be overly optimistic. On the other hand, if growth sputters or a downturn emerges, history suggests the Fed <b>tends to cut more</b> than initially planned. The average Fed easing in a recession has been around 400 bps , far above the ~200 bps now expected. Should unemployment jump markedly or credit conditions worsen, the Fed may ultimately overshoot the currently projected cuts (just as it has often done in past recessions). At this juncture, with inflation ~3% and unemployment ~4%, the baseline outcome likely skews toward a mild easing cycle – but <b>both upside and downside scenarios loom large</b>. Wall Street’s consensus for a late-2024 start and gradual 2025 cuts could be upended if inflation surprises upward (forcing the Fed to delay or even hike again), or if a sharper slowdown hits (forcing faster, larger cuts). In summary, the market and Fed are <b>not fully aligned</b>: investors bet on a moderate cutting cycle commencing soon, while the Fed signals a later and shallower path. The actual trajectory will hinge on incoming data – with the Fed willing to deviate quickly if either inflation or growth veers off course.</p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p> </p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-subheading intercom-interblocks-align-left"><h2 id="h_a5a791089e"><b>Five Expert Takes</b></h2></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p><i>Predictions and perspectives from top market watchers on the coming rate-cut cycle:</i></p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p>• <b>Michael Feroli, J.P.

That implies a fed funds rate falling from a peak of about 5.25% in 2023 to somewhere near 3.25%–3.75% in the next two years – a moderation toward neutral policy, but not an outright return to the zero-rate era in the baseline scenario. This trajectory assumes inflation continues to trend down toward 2% and the economy skirts a severe recession. Under those conditions, the Fed is poised to take a middle road: cutting enough to support growth, but not so aggressively as to reignite inflation or deplete its ammo too quickly. The current market consensus – expecting the first cut around late-2024 and a modest series of reductions through 2025 – is <b>plausible</b> given historical patterns in non-recessionary slowdowns . Past soft landings (1995, 2019) saw the Fed nip off about 0.75–1.00% in rates before stabilizing. The anticipated ~2% easing this time is slightly larger, reflecting the higher starting point and initially higher inflation, but it still falls well short of the mega-cut cycles of 5–10% witnessed in outright recessions.</p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p> </p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-subheading intercom-interblocks-align-left"><h2 id="h_b15e473cf8"><b>Key risks to this outlook</b></h2></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p>The biggest risk is <b>economic deterioration</b> – if the economy slides into a deeper recession than expected (for example, if restrictive policy and credit conditions finally crack the labor market), the Fed could be forced to cut rates <i>earlier and far more</i> than the current consensus. In a downturn scenario, all bets are off: we could see an aggressive easing cycle of several percentage points, as was the norm in past recessions (the Fed has often cut on the order of 500+ bps in recessions like 1981-82, 2001, 2008 ). Conversely, there’s a risk of <b>inflation persisting above target</b>, which would make the Fed very reluctant to cut at all. If core inflation plateaus in the 3–4% range or an oil price spike or other shock reignites price pressures, the Fed might delay rate cuts significantly (or even hike again) – echoing the 1970s “stop-go” experience. This would invalidate market expectations of imminent relief and keep rates “higher for longer” until inflation decisively cracks. Another risk factor is the <b>“unknown unknowns”</b> – geopolitical events, a financial crisis, or policy mistakes. For instance, a global shock or a financial accident (perhaps in highly leveraged sectors or emerging markets struggling with high U.S. rates) could prompt an emergency Fed response (as seen in 1998’s rapid cuts, or March 2020’s pandemic shock). Additionally, the new president and subsequent fiscal policy changes could influence the Fed’s path: a large fiscal expansion or contraction might affect growth and inflation, altering the need for rate adjustments. Fed officials like Powell have also stressed the need to see clear evidence of cooling in the job market – if that evidence doesn’t materialize until much later, the Fed could hold off longer than markets project .</p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p> </p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p>In conclusion, the likely case is that the Fed will <i>gingerly</i> transition to rate cuts in the coming months, aiming to orchestrate a soft landing by easing policy just enough to sustain the expansion while anchoring inflation. The market’s consensus timeline of a mild easing in 2025, appears broadly on track – *<i>provided the economy behaves</i>. History suggests that the Fed will adjust course if needed: cutting deeper if recession strikes, or pausing if inflation remains “sticky.” Investors and borrowers should thus prepare for a base case of gradually lower rates ahead, but remain cognizant of those twin risks. The Fed’s delicate balancing act – fighting yesterday’s inflation war while guarding against tomorrow’s recession – will determine whether this rate cut cycle is a gentle glide path or a bumpy ride. Policymakers have invoked the mantra “higher for longer,” but as 2025 unfolds, it will become clear whether “lower at last” takes hold. For now, all signs point to <b>rate relief on the horizon</b> – not a moment too soon for markets, yet likely not as fast or as deep as the most bullish forecasts would hope, unless the economy forces the Fed’s hand.</p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p> </p></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-subheading intercom-interblocks-align-left"><h2 id="h_2d164de599"><b>Footnotes &amp; Sources:</b></h2></div><div class="intercom-interblocks-paragraph no-margin intercom-interblocks-align-left"><p>1.
