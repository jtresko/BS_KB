# Introduction

Manipulation and Market Maker Price Discovery (MMPD) are two of our most exciting proprietary indicators, but they’re still in the early stages of development. While we can’t disclose their exact workings, this article will help you understand a bit more about them. For more information on these indicators, our [Discord community](https://intercom.help/bigshort/en/articles/10372185-how-to-join-our-members-only-discord-channels) is the best place to learn more. 

Both of these indicators are found together on the same chart and can be viewed on the [SmartFlow](https://intercom.help/bigshort/en/articles/10445405-smartflow-tab) and [UltraFlow](https://intercom.help/bigshort/en/articles/10442189-understanding-the-ultraflow-tab) tabs.

🚨 **Warning** : These indicators are not really meant for people who are new to BigShort and/or inexperienced traders.

# Manipulation

As the name implies, Manipulation is an indicator of the extent of potential price manipulation of a stock. The larger the orange bar, the more manipulation is taking place. 

## **Key Characteristics**

  * The Manipulation values are **relative** to the symbol you’re analyzing.

  * There are **no fixed units** for the values displayed. Instead, they represent a proprietary calculation that factors in many variables.

  * While there is no theoretical maximum for these values, historical context can provide insights. For example, observing past spikes for a symbol like SPY can help gauge what is considered a “high” or “low” value for a given ticker.




💡 **Tip:** During periods of high, condensed activity for a stock (FOMC, earnings, big news, FDA approvals, etc.) Manipulation often acts as a strong inverse indicator. So if there's big news or an event and lots of volume and big MomoFlow bars and you see a large M Bar pointing down, that's a bullish signal, while a large M Bar pointing up is a bearish signal.
