If you're not in already - join the BigShort Discord. As one trader puts it "this is the crown jewel of the whole thing!"  
​  
If you've already joined, you no doubt have seen traders talking about SE all over. Confused? Look no further, your answers to all SE (short exempt) questions are below!  
​  
​

# Why does SE Matter to BigShort Traders?

High SE readings very often come immediately before large volatile moves in a stock. For BigShort traders, SE is a way to identify which tickers to pay attention to in the coming day or days.   
​

# How do I find SE on BigShort?

You can find the Top 10 Short Exempt tickers in the[ Dashboard tab](https://help.bigshort.com/en/articles/10362240-dashboard-top-10s). There you'll find stocks that are likely to experience significant volatility. See below in Pink. Notice the top two tickers on the top 10 last night, INOD and HIMS (for a [play-by-play using SE to trade HIMS](https://help.bigshort.com/en/articles/10630102-how-bigshort-trader-jp24-identified-hims-for-a-14-move-today) read this).

**What Is Short Exempt?**

For those curious, here's a bit about what's happening under the hood with SE. Short exempt is a special short-selling designation that sidesteps certain trading restrictions, particularly the short sale restriction (SSR).  
​

# **Why Does Short Exempt Lead to Volatility?**

  * **Uptick Rule Exemption** : Under the SSR, traders can only short on an uptick (i.e., when the stock trades above the last sale price). **A short exempt order bypasses this rule.**

  * **Market Maker Liquidity** : Most short exempt orders come from market makers who must maintain liquidity. It’s not a blanket exemption for all shorts. This means high SE is likely a sign that the market makers are out of position and the stock needs to reposition.

  * **Tape Reading** : Seeing short exempt in the order flow can signal that a large participant is shorting without typical SSR constraints. This may affect the pace of selling.




# **Pro Tips**

  * **Watch for Unusual Shorting Activity** : Short exempt orders can move a stock’s price aggressively during SSR periods.

  * **Corroborate Signals** : Combine short exempt data with other BigShort indicators to build confidence in the direction and duration of the trade — [Net Options Flow](https://help.bigshort.com/en/articles/10354751-net-option-flow-a-complete-guide), [Dark Pools](https://help.bigshort.com/en/articles/10280483-understanding-dark-pools-and-darkflow-in-bigshort), and [MomoFlow](https://help.bigshort.com/en/articles/10361455-understanding-smartflow-and-momoflow-indicators) to gauge market sentiment. Enter if a confluence of signals agree.
